# Last Implementation Handoff

## S2.4.1 — Cost Basis Truth Hardening + Allocation Proposal Recovery

### Lineage and authority

- Repository/canonical branch: `harmonicforce/russellvault2`, `main`.
- Branch: `codex/s2-4-1-cost-basis-truth-hardening`.
- Exact base SHA: `deca424928a698db3cb456c53ca0a6cc950d05ed`.
- Release authority: branch/PR only. No merge, push, hosted migration, deployment,
  production restart, or production data action was authorized.
- `docs/ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` is untouched.

### Implemented database changes

Two forward-only additive migrations leave the merged S2.4 migration untouched:

1. `20260815000100_cost_allocation_withdrawn_state.sql` adds the terminal
   `withdrawn` allocation state in its own transaction-safe migration.
2. `20260815000200_cost_basis_truth_hardening.sql`:
   - adds owner/operator-only `withdraw_cost_allocation(uuid,text)`, requires a
     nonblank reason, preserves candidate rows and reasoned audit history, permits
     later corrected proposals, and serializes confirm/withdraw on the same
     component row lock;
   - makes allocation transition enforcement treat `withdrawn` as terminal and
     records `cost_allocation_withdrawn` in the existing audit vocabulary;
   - makes the derived-table guard fail closed when its GUC is unset using
     `coalesce(current_setting(..., true), '')`;
   - replaces cost-basis algorithm `1.0.0` with `1.1.0`, expanding unresolved
     order/lot shared evidence to every active acquisition line in scope;
   - emits null-money `unresolved` rows, while retaining normalized known
     contributions, whenever applicable direct/shared evidence is unknown,
     unresolved, candidate, or otherwise unattributable;
   - sends negative net unit basis to the same explicit unresolved state rather
     than publishing a current negative inventory value;
   - removes trust in undeclared `source_detail.specific_unit_costs_minor` for
     multi-unit serialized lines. Multi-unit attribution is deterministic equal;
     quantity-one serialized item-price lines may retain source-specific method.

FIFO ordering, expected-quantity denominators, remainder distribution,
overreceipt handling, and currency separation are unchanged.

### Tests and evidence

- `67_governed_inventory_cost_basis.sql`: 41/41 assertions. Added regressions
  for unset GUC direct DML, candidate order-shared blocking with known subtotal,
  history-preserving reasoned withdrawal and replacement, arbitrary multi-unit
  source JSON, unknown direct evidence, lot-shared unresolved propagation,
  negative net basis, and overlapping confirm-versus-withdraw with exactly one
  winner.
- `06_provenance_structure.sql`: migration ledger updated for 76 migrations.
- Plain PostgreSQL reset passed.
- Full plain PostgreSQL pgTAP passed: 67 files, 2592 assertions.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm test` passed: server 686, client 1431, Node guards 23 (2140 total).
- `npm run build:ci` passed with the existing Vite chunk-size warning.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Initial typecheck/test/build attempts failed because client/server dependencies
  were absent. `npm ci --prefix client` and `npm ci --prefix server` restored the
  environment without tracked changes; the mandated commands then passed.
- An initial pgTAP run exposed and corrected the expected migration-ledger count;
  the final full run is green.

### Delivery status

- Final SHA: recorded in the final response after commit.
- PR: not created in this environment; the work order explicitly reserves PR
  creation for the owner's Codex Create PR button and forbids `gh` push/create.
- Exact-head hosted CI: not checked; branch was not pushed.
- Live Supabase migration count/parity: not checked; not authorized.
- Railway deployment and `/api/version`: not checked; not authorized.
- Hosted acceptance: not applicable (no client/server/UI change) and not authorized.
- Production data touched: none.
- Rollback before deployment: revert the feature commit. After any separately
  authorized migration deployment, use another forward migration.

### Exact next owner decision

Use Codex's Create PR button for the committed branch, obtain green exact-head CI,
and then decide whether to merge. Do not apply either migration live until that
separate release decision.
